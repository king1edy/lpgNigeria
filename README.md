LPG NIGERIA
LPG in Nigeria is a non-profit organization with a building block of advocacy to share information on LPG that guarantees growth and usage of LPG while creating a
levelling playing field for LPG companies. Our framework enforces community development with the right elements to disseminate necessary information to help the LPG ecosystem.
It is an established fact that LPG has a number of practical and environmental advantages over other fuels.
It is portable, efficient, safe and emits virtually no soot.
